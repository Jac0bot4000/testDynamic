        <h1>Visit the Beautiful Cape Cod, Massachusetts</h1>
            <p class="overview">Welcome to Cape Cod Massachusetts—commonly referred to as “The Cape”—where you can find beautiful beaches, extensive bike trails, delicious restaurants, and charming small towns. What makes the Cape so welcoming is not only the breadth of activities available, but also the range in demographics they are geared towards; there is no difficulty in finding something to do with your family, or activities designed with adults in mind. Because of this, there is no doubt in why it remains one of the go-to vacation spot for many New Englanders.</p>
            <h2 id="history">History</h2>
                <p>Formed more than 18,000 years ago by glacial retreat, the sandy peninsula that extends into the Atlantic Ocean was originally home to the Wampanoag People, the Native American Tribe local to the area <a href="references.html#1">(1)</a>. However, come the 1600s and European exploration, English pilgrims began to take over the land and settle what would be known as Plymouth Colony <a href="references.html#2">(2)</a>. In fact, one of the earliest explores, Bartholomew Gosnold, coined the name “Cape Cod” after the large swaths of codfish that can be found in region <a href="references.html#2">(2)</a>.</p>
                <p>Because of the Cape's proximity to Boston and New York City, it became a hub for fishing, whaling, and shipping <a href="references.html#3">(3)</a>. To improve the safety and efficiency of these thriving industries, the US Army Corp of Engineers began the construction of the Cape Cod Canal in 1909, finishing in 1914 <a href="references.html#4">(4)</a>. This greatly reduced the naval distance between Boston and New York City, cutting down 75 miles that previously rand across rough, treacherous waters around the peninsula <a href="references.html#4">(4)</a>. This canal now serves as a landmark to the Cape with its two large highway bridges connecting to mainland Massachusetts, which are common identifying markers for vacationers who claim they “see the bridge” as they get close.</p>
            <h2>Getting There</h2>
                <h3>By Car</h3>
                    <p>From the North...</p>
                    <div class="indent">
                        <p>Take I-93 to Rt 3 from Boston, then cross over the Sagamore Bridge before continuing along Rt 6, which runs the entire length of the Cape.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>From the West/South...</p>
                    <div class="indent">
                        <p>Take I-95 to I-495 before joining with Rt 25. At the Canal, traffic will dictate whether you cross over the Bourne Bridge or get off the highway directly before and travel along the canal before crossing over the Sagamore Bridge.</p>
                    </div>
                <h3>By Plane</h3>
                    <p>Small charter flights operate out of Hyannis Airport, and you can connect through Boston Logan or Providence, Rhode Island. Because these flights can become quite pricey, it is more cost effective to fly into Boston or Providence, rent a car, and drive the rest of the way since you really do need a car to navigate the Cape.</p>
                <h3 id="ferry">Ferry</h3>
                    <p>A daily, seasonal ferry operates between Boston and Provincetown <a href="references.html#5">(5)</a>. This option is good if you are only looking to go to P-Town for a day or two since it is only passenger service, and no motor vehicles are allowed on the ship <a href="references.html#5">(5)</a>.</p>
