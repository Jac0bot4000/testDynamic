        <h2 id="redCottage">Red Cottage Restaurant</h2>
            <p class="address">36 Old Bass River Rd, South Dennis, MA 02660</p>
            <p>For a Mid-Cape classic, The Red Cottage is a must. It has a very cozy and rustic atmosphere, with both counter and table seating. Because of its small size, it is recommended to arrive early in the morning, otherwise you may have a significant wait—one that is definitely worth it—especially during tourist season.</p>
            <p>While offering both breakfast and lunch, they are known for their amazing Red Cottage Home Fries, their take on a classic home fry dish, including potatoes with onions, tomatoes, ham, green peppers and mushrooms topped with a lemon Hollandaise sauce. This is what put them on the map. In addition to their home fries, a must-try is their cinnamon bun french toast: two thick slices of texas style french toast covered in a delicious cinnamon bun icing.</p>
            <p>An important note when visiting is that the Red Cottage is cash only, but they have an ATM on site if you forget.</p>
