        <h1>Lodging</h1>
        <h2>Rent a Cottage</h2>
            <p>Cottages are for rent all over the Cape. They vary greatly in price based on size, location, quality, and many other factors. You can find a beautiful house right on the beach, but expect to pay a good chunk of change per night. On the contrary, you can find a quite affordable place if you are willing to be a bit further inland, or stay in a smaller place. Remember, you are not going on vacation to stay home; treat it as lodging, not your destination.</p>
            <p>An important thing to note is that these houses get rented early; if you are looking to vacation during the summer, you can expect to book during late winter towards early spring. For renting, it is common to find vacation homes on <a href="https://www.weneedavacation.com/"> We Need A Vacation</a> or <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/s/Cape-Cod--Massachusetts--United-States/homes?tab_id=home_tab&refinement_paths%5B%5D=%2Fhomes&flexible_trip_lengths%5B%5D=one_week&monthly_start_date=2024-11-01&monthly_length=3&monthly_end_date=2025-02-01&price_filter_input_type=0&channel=EXPLORE&query=Cape%20Cod%2C%20MA&place_id=ChIJTelJAUQV-4kRC7IcAPoOnB8&location_bb=QihUS8KL22tCJg9Zwo1gFg%3D%3D&date_picker_type=calendar&source=structured_search_input_header&search_type=autocomplete_click">Airbnb</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="camping">Camping</h2>
            <p>If you are a fan of the outdoors, there are great options for camping on the Cape. Most notably is Nickerson State Park situated in Brewster, Massachusetts. There are over 400 sites here, most of which are designated for tent camping. The area has paved paths, swimming areas, boat rentals, and full-service restrooms; additionally, the Cape Cod Rail trail runs right through the park, so there is easy access for those who wish to bike during their stay <a href="references.html#7">(7)</a>.</p>

        <h2>Hotel/Motel</h2>
            <p>A fantastic option for smaller groups or individual travelers are hotels or motels. There is no shortage of motels on the Cape, with many locations situated along Rt 28. Rt 28 is a main connector that makes for easy transport along the Sound of Cape Cod. One of the benefits of staying at a Motel is that they can be significantly cheaper than other lodging options. Also, in recent years, many have been updating their facilities to promote a more pleasant stay.</p>
