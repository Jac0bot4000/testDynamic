        <h1>Beaches</h1>
            <p class="overview">One of the main attractions on the Cape are the beautiful, world-class beaches. There are two main categories of beaches on the cape, classified by location: bay side and sound side. Bay side beaches tend to have calmer surf and massive tides, making it great for families with small children, or those looking for a more relaxing experience. The sound side beaches commonly have bigger, stronger waves which are great for those looking to do various activities on the water such as surfing.</p>

            <h2>Bay Side</h2>
                <h3>Mayflower Beach</h3>
                    <p class="address">14 Horsefoot Path, Dennis, MA 02638</p>
                    <p>One of the perks of Mayflower Beach is that it has updated restroom and dining facilities, making it a favorite for many families with young children. The snack bar serves both hot food and ice cream, as well as delicious frozen lemonade.</p>
                    <p>An important note is that because of the popularity of the beach, it is very difficult to get parking, so you have to be sure to show up really early in the dayâ€”usually before 10:30am. If you are close enough, it is recommended that you walk or bike to the beach so that you do not have to wait in line for the parking lot.</p>
                    <p>A cool aspect of Mayflower beach is how far the tide goes out, more than quadrupling the size of the beach as the ocean recedes nearly a mile.</p>

                    <p class="address">90 Chapin Beach Rd, Dennis, MA 02638</p>
                    <p>Chapin Beach has a more relaxed feel, as there is much more space for visitors to spread out; because of this, it is not as overcrowded as its neighbor, Mayflower. There is limited parking here which also tends to fill up.</p>
                    <p>During low tide, there are many small pools of water that are perfect for little children to splash around it, making it perfect for families <a href="references.html#8">(8)</a>.</p>
                    <p>In the evenings, its is a common spot for many to visit to see the sunset, as it is flat on both sides of the area, and there are beautiful views as the sun sinks below the horizon. A great location to watch it set is along the road leading up to the beach, as there is enough space to pull off and get out, especially during low tide.</p>
